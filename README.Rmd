# rAltmetric

This package provides a way to programmatically retrieve altmetric data from [altmetric.com](http://altmetric.com) for any publication with the appropriate identifer. The package is really simple to use and only has two major functions: One (`altmetrics()`) to download metrics and another (`altmetric_data()`) to extract the data into a `data.frame`. It also includes generic S3 methods to plot/print metrics for any altmetric object.

# Installing the package

A stable version is available from CRAN. To install

```r
install.packages('rAltmetric')

or install the development version

devtools::install_github("ropensci/rAltmetric")
```


# Quick Tutorial

## Obtaining metrics
There was a recent paper by [Acuna et al](http://www.nature.com/news/2010/100616/full/465860a.html) that received a lot of attention on Twitter. What was the impact of that paper?

```{r}
library(rAltmetric)
acuna <- altmetrics(doi = "10.1038/465860a")
acuna
```


## Data
To obtain the metrics in tabular form for further processing, run any object of class `altmetric` through `altmetric_data()` to get data that can easily be written to disk as a spreadsheet.

```{r}
altmetric_data(acuna)
```

You can save these data into a clean spreadsheet format:

```r
acuna_data <- altmetric_data(acuna)
readr::write_csv(acuna_data, path = 'acuna_altmetrics.csv')
```

# Gathering metrics for many DOIs
For a real world use-case, one might want to get metrics on multiple publications. If so, just read them from a spreadsheet and `llply` through them like the example below.

```{r}
library(rAltmetric)
ids <- c(
    "10.1038/nature09210",
    "10.1126/science.1187820",
    "10.1016/j.tree.2011.01.009",
    "10.1086/664183"
  )

alm <- function(x) {
  altmetrics(doi = x) %>% altmetric_data()
}

z <- lapply(ids, alm) 
results <- bind_rows(z) 
```
